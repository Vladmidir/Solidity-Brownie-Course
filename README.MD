# Learning Solidity
Here I will save my .sol files that I write while getting to know how to use Solidity

I am using the Remix solidity IDE for development and just copy paste the code I write there to my local machine, 
so that it can be easily referenced. 

## Order of the "projects"
This this the order in which I have build the files included in this folder
1. SimpleStorage.sol
2. StorageFactory.sol
